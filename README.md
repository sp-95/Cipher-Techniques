# Cipher-Techniques
### CYCLE - I
1. Consider a string of characters consisting of lowercase and uppercase characters. Write a program to Encrypt and decrypt the string using Caesar cipher by replacing lower case characters with shift k1 and uppercase characters with shift k2. Also launch brute force attack and derive the keys.
2. Write a program to perform the following using Playfair cipher technique:
  1. Encrypt  a given message M with different keys {k1,k2,â€¦,kn}.  Print key and cipher text pair
  2. Decrypt the cipher texts obtained in (i) to get back M
3. Write a program to perform the following using Hill cipher:
  1. Encrypt a message M with a given key matrix of size 2X2 and 3X3
  2. Decrypt the cipher text obtained in (i) by computing inverse of the respective key matrix.
4. Write a program to perform encryption and decryption using transposition technique with column permutation given as key.
5. Encrypt a given text file using mono-alphabetic cipher and store the cipher text in a file. Cryptanalize the cipher text obtained using frequency analysis.
6. Write a program to generate and print 48-bit keys for all sixteen rounds of DES algorithm, given a 64-bit initial key.
7. Given 64-bit output of (i-1)th round of DES, 56-bit (i-1)th round key Ki and E table, write a program to print the 48-bit input for S-box in the ith round of DES.
8. Given 48-bit input to S-box, permutation table P and 32-bit input Li-1, write program to print the 32-bit output Ri of ith round of DES algorithm.
